    This article explains how to reverse engineer Samsung's proprietary bootloader a.k.a. aboot and describes an 
    undocumented feature which allows an end user to lock his bootloader and to prevent someone from using the download
    mode without his consent.

Introduction
------------

Most of the time, when you read an article on bootloader and security, there are chances that it will talk about exploiting a vulnerability to unlock a bootloader. This article takes a different path and explains how to **lock** Samsung's proprietary bootloader (aboot) and to disable the download mode.

In France, and certainly in many countries, Samsung sells smartphones with an unlocked bootloader. That's cool, you can easily root your device. Unfortunately, this also means that anyone can take your phone and flash it in order to infect your phone or to grab your data. To the best of our knowledge, there is no public way to lock your bootloader and to prevent that attack scenario from happening.

Fortunately for us, Samsung left an "`undocumented <https://www.stigviewer.com/stig/samsung_android_with_knox_1.x/2014-04-22/finding/V-48251>`_" mechanism in their devices to lock the download mode and to prevent a third party from flashing anything through ODIN.
This article is based on Samsung Galaxy S5, but it should works on many others Samsung devices.

Samsung aboot bootloader
------------------------

When you power on a smartphone, several bootloaders are executed consecutively. Most of the time, you have a PBL (Primary Boot Loader) which is stored in ROM that is executed the first. It loads and executes a SBL (Secondary Boot Loader) which is stored in Flash. PBL and SBL are bootloaders provided by the SoC manufacturer and you can't modify them because they are stored in ROM or they are signed. To allow an OEM to have his own bootloader, the SBL loads and executes the OEM bootloader if its signature is verified. For Samsung devices, the OEM bootloader is *aboot*.

What is interesting for us is that aboot is based on an open-source bootloader called LK (`Little Kernel <https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/lk/>`_). This helped a lot during reverse engineering, because one can recover symbols using strings leftover, or by recompilating the LK bootloader and diffing with aboot. But first, let's get our hand on aboot binary.

The aboot bootloader can be easily extracted from a Samsung ROM:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tar tvf G900FXXU1BNL9_G900FOXX1BNL3_G900FXXU1BNL9_HOME.tar.md5
    -rw-rw-r-- dpi/dpi      986200 2014-12-18 11:09 aboot.mbn
    -rw-rw-r-- dpi/dpi     7590656 2014-12-18 11:09 NON-HLOS.bin
    -rw-rw-r-- dpi/dpi      228488 2014-12-18 11:08 rpm.mbn
    -rw-rw-r-- dpi/dpi      317572 2014-12-18 11:08 sbl1.mbn
    -rw-rw-r-- dpi/dpi      361476 2014-12-18 11:08 tz.mbn
    -rw-rw-r-- dpi/dpi    12343568 2014-12-18 11:09 boot.img
    -rw-rw-r-- dpi/dpi    12747024 2014-12-18 11:09 recovery.img
    -rw-r--r-- dpi/dpi  2373600960 2014-12-18 11:10 system.img.ext4
    -rw-r--r-- dpi/dpi    54855424 2014-12-18 07:25 modem.bin
    -rw-r--r-- dpi/dpi    50708700 2014-12-24 04:23 cache.img.ext4
    -rw-r--r-- dpi/dpi     7270584 2014-12-24 04:23 hidden.img.ext4
    $ tar xvf G900FXXU1BNL9_G900FOXX1BNL3_G900FXXU1BNL9_HOME.tar.md5 aboot.mbn


We get a MBN file, which is simply an ARM executable code prefixed with a 40 bytes (0x28) `header <http://newandroidbook.com/Articles/aboot.html>`_. In this header, we can find the ImgBase of aboot which
will be used in IDA Pro to rebase the binary:

.. figure:: /static/images/aboot/aboot_header.png
    :align: center
    :alt: aboot header parsed by 010editor

The first thing we see in the bootloader's executable code is the Exception Vector Table:

.. figure:: /static/images/aboot/evt.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Exception Vector Table of aboot

From :cpp:`_reset` to :cpp:`aboot_init()` functions, we have classical LK flow of execution. Functions called until :cpp:`aboot_init()` are mostly executed for hardware/memory initialization purpose.

.. figure:: /static/images/aboot/callgraph.png
    :align: center
    :alt: callgraph from _reset() to aboot_init()

There are no symbols in the aboot.mbn file. However, it's based on the opensource LK bootloader. Thus, it's pretty easy most of the time to recover symbols, especially when :cpp:`dprintf()` debug logs are left in the binary. 
More symbols can also be identified by compiling LK from qualcomm msm8974 SoC and by using bindiff (*Pro-tip: Bindiff's algorithm "string references" can give interesting results.*):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/lk -b qcom-dima-8x74-fixes
    $ cd lk
    $ export TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX=arm-linux-gnueabi
    $ make msm8974
    $ ls build-msm8974
    app  arch  config.h  dev  emmc_appsboot.mbn  emmc_appsboot.raw  EMMCBOOT.MBN  kernel  lib  lk  lk.bin  lk.debug.lst  lk.lst  lk.size  lk.sym  mkheader  platform  system-onesegment.ld  target
    $ file build-msm8974/lk
    lk: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, EABI5 version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, not stripped

.. figure:: /static/images/aboot/bindiff.png
    :align: center
    :alt: bindiff results between LK and Aboot

Let's get back on the topic. We are in the :cpp:`aboot_init` function. 
Traditionally, this function is used to choose in which mode the device should boot. According to pressed hardware keys (if the user presses VOLUME_UP for example) or the boot reason, it can start fastboot, boot in recovery or boot Android from the flash.
In Samsung's case, it can additionally load the download mode when the user press VOLUME_DOWN and HOME keys. 

A few instructions before the launch of ODIN through a call to :cpp:`odin3_init()`, something catches our eyes:

.. figure:: /static/images/aboot/is_CC_mode.png
    :align: center
    :alt: CC flag value check before odin3_init()

CC mode and the param partition
-------------------------------

Based on the CFG in the previous screenshot, we note that the bootloader
will either execute :cpp:`odin3_init()` or display the message "DOWNLOAD IS BLOCKED BY CC MODE" on screen 
depending on :cpp:`is_CC_mode()` return value.

When disassembled, :cpp:`is_CC_mode()` has the following instructions:

.. figure:: /static/images/aboot/is_cc_mode_func.png
    :align: center
    :alt: is_cc_mode() disassembly
    
It returns the DWORD located at ``0xF8E9054``. Xrefs for this address indicates
that only one function writes at this location. Let's rename this function to :cpp:`init_cc_flag_value()`. 

.. figure:: /static/images/aboot/init_cc_flag_value.png
    :align: center
    :alt: init_cc_flag_value() decompiled code

From a high level point of view, a 64 bytes buffer is read via the function renamed :cpp:`do_param_partition_operation()`, transformed 
into another smaller buffer (32 bytes) via the function renamed to :cpp:`tranform_data()` and finally, some comparisons are done on this buffer to check 
if the CC flag should be set to 1 or 0. It's important to note that the :cpp:`init_cc_flag_value()` is called by the :cpp:`aboot_init()` function in 
:cpp:`aboot_check_mode()`.

Let's go a bit deeper by analyzing the functions :cpp:`do_param_partition_operation()` and :cpp:`transform_data()`.

The function :cpp:`do_param_partition_operation()` is used to read or write data into a partition named "param". The reconstructed function header can be:

.. code-block:: cpp

    int do_param_partition_operation(char *buffer, unsigned int size, unsigned int type, unsigned int operation);

The param partition is used to store different types of data that are Samsung-specific. The :cpp:`type` parameter
is used to calculate the offset at which the operation will be done. The :cpp:`operation` parameter is used to specify if we want to read (0) or 
write (1) data. And finally :cpp:`buffer` and :cpp:`size` are used to specify the address of the buffer to be read or to be written and its size.

Based on these information, the call to :cpp:`do_param_partition_operation()` in :cpp:`init_cc_flag_value()` reads 64 bytes 
from the *param* partition starting at the offset (end - 2048) and stores the bytes read into :cpp:`input`;

Let's take a look at the data located at this offset. Dumping the param partition on a Samsung Galaxy S5 gives us the following results:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ adb shell
    shell@klte:/ $ su
    root@klte:/data/local/tmp # dd if=/dev/block/param of=/sdcard/param.raw bs=4096
    $ adb pull /sdcard/param.raw
    $ hexdump -C param.raw

    00a00000

The param partition has a size of 0x00A00000 and we want to read the last 2048 bytes, which means we will start reading at hex(0x00a00000 - 2048) => 0x9ff800.
Looking at the hexdump output, this buffer of 64 bytes is not human readable and looks like random bytes. It is probably encrypted.

Let's try to understand how these data are used when the function renamed to :cpp:`transform_data` is called:

.. figure:: /static/images/aboot/transform_data_crypto.png
    :align: center
    :alt: transform_data() decompiled code

Multiple functions are called inside :cpp:`transform_data` and it seems to initialize properties of an object that has been renamed ctx (for context). The signature of these functions make us think of cryptography primitives: we have a buffer of 16 bytes at :cpp:`dword_F8E7AD0` (maybe an IV?), a big "table" of 40960 bytes (certainly multiple smaller tables) at :cpp:`dword_F8DDAD0` and power of 2 constants (16/32).

.. figure:: /static/images/aboot/wb_table.png
    :align: center
    :alt: whitebox tables

One of the inner function called by :cpp:`transform_data` is a substitution on a 16 bytes array, which reminds invShiftRows operation in AES:

.. figure:: /static/images/aboot/invShiftRows.png
    :align: center
    :alt: kind of invShiftRows function

It seems that we are indeed in presence of cryptography, probably AES related. It looks like a `whitebox cryptography <http://www.whiteboxcrypto.com>`_ implementation as we only have tables but no hardcoded key.

Instead of reverse engineering these functions, which can be time consuming without symbols, let's try to search for binaries related to them:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ grep -Rn NOCC .
	system/lib/libSecurityManagerNative.so
	
YAY! A result! And the exported functions look promising:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    [...]    
    getCCModeFlag 0x00035A8
    getSBFlag 0x0002D6C 
    setCCModeFlag 000030D0 
    [...]
    WAES_Create_Cipher 0x0004B1C 
    WAES_Decrypt 0x0004C0C 
    WAES_Encrypt 0x0004BAC 
    WAES_Free_Cipher 0x0004C68 
    WAES_Set_Initial_Vector 0x0004C78 
    WAES_Set_T_Box 0x0004B44 
    [...]

Pretty interesting, isn't it ? We have functions to get/set CC flag, and many functions prefixed by WAES (for Whitebox AES ?) :)

To sum up, if we put specific data at a specific location in the param partition, then we can prevent aboot to switch the download mode.
This data is encrypted by something that seems to be a whitebox AES implementation. This becomes more interesting :)

One may think that forging AES encrypted data without having the key seems to be problematic, but it's not. Even if I'm not a crypto guy
and I don't break the whitebox AES implementation (maybe in a next blog post?), I can still use the whitebox as an oracle and 
ask it to encrypt or decrypt data for me without having to know the key.

Indeed, we can invoke the code inside libSecurityManagerNative.so with :cpp:`dlsym()`/:cpp:`dlopen()`. The library contains a function named
:cpp:`setSBFlag()` which will write NOCC or FFOC based on the value (1 or 0) of its 2nd argument:

.. figure:: /static/images/aboot/write_SBFlag.png
    :align: center
    :alt: write_SBFlag() decompiled code

Let's build a simple wrapper around this library:

.. code-block:: cpp

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <dlfcn.h>
    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>

    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
        if(argc < 2){
            printf("Usage: %s <0/1> (0: unlock, 1: lock)\n", argv[0]);
            return 1;
        }

        void *lib = dlopen("/system/lib/libSecurityManagerNative.so", RTLD_LAZY);
        printf("lib = %p\n", lib);
        if(lib == NULL){
            printf("dlerror: %s\n",dlerror());
            return 1;
        }

        //setSBFlag(int arg1, int arg2)
        int (*setSBFlag)(int arg1, int arg2);
        setSBFlag = dlsym(lib, "setSBFlag");
        printf("setSBFlag = %p\n", setSBFlag);

        if(SBFlag){
            printf("Unlocking the download mode!\n");
            (*setSBFlag)(0, 0);    
        }else{
            printf("Locking the download mode!\n");
            (*setSBFlag)(1, 0);
        }
       
        return 0;
    }

Now, we only have to push this wrapper in /data/local/tmp and run it as root:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ adb push change_lock_status /data/local/tmp
    $ adb shell
    shell@klte:/ $ su
    root@klte:/data/local/tmp # ./change_lock_status 1
    $ adb reboot download

And finally here is the result:

.. figure:: /static/images/aboot/download_locked.png
    :align: center
    :alt: example of locked download mode

Custom recovery and adbd
------------------------

This is great, your download mode is locked! Now, what if you soft-brick your device for a random reason and you need to reflash it ? You can't access download mode anymore, which is a bit problematic.

To prevent such access loss and to allow easy switching between locked and unlocked state, I decided to implement a new command inside the adbd daemon and to put the modified adbd in the recovery of my smartphone. This way, each time I need to unlock the download mode, I only have to boot in recovery, enter the good password through the custom adb command, and then reboot in download mode. 

*Note: to implement this quick and dirty PoC, I used a Samsung Galaxy S5 (SM-G900F) test device running Android 5.0 (LRX21T.G900FXXU1BNL9)*

Because we need to allow modification of *param* partition, our custom adbd binary has to be executed as root. To avoid bypass or security issues, we need to reduce the attack surface and we must not to expose *adbd* functionalities like *adb shell* or jdwp. I have chosen to implement a new `service <http://androidxref.com/5.0.0_r2/xref/system/core/adb/SERVICES.TXT>`_ (command) in minadbd instead reusing of adbd. `Minadbd is a light version of adbd <http://androidxref.com/5.0.0_r2/xref/bootable/recovery/minadbd/README.txt>`_, used generally to expose only the adb sideloading feature of a stock recovery.

These are my modifications of minadbd's source code from AOSP:

1. We need to modify the Android.mk of minadbd to build a ELF static binary executable instead of the default libminadbd. You can append these lines at the end of the default minadbd's Android.mk file: 

.. code-block:: bash

    # minadbd binary
    # =========================================================

    include $(CLEAR_VARS)

    LOCAL_SRC_FILES := \
	    adb.c \
	    fdevent.c \
	    fuse_adb_provider.c \
	    transport.c \
	    transport_usb.c \
	    sockets.c \
	    services.c \
	    usb_linux_client.c \
	    utils.c

    LOCAL_CFLAGS := -O2 -g -DADB_HOST=0 -Wall -Wno-unused-parameter
    LOCAL_CFLAGS += -D_XOPEN_SOURCE -D_GNU_SOURCE
    LOCAL_C_INCLUDES += bootable/recovery

    LOCAL_MODULE := minadbd
    LOCAL_FORCE_STATIC_EXECUTABLE := true
    LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES := libfusesideload libcutils libc libmincrypt

    include $(BUILD_EXECUTABLE)

2. Then, we need to register two new "services" by adding them in the *service_to_fd* function:


.. code-block:: C
		
	int service_to_fd(const char *name)
	{
	    int ret = -1;
	    if(!strncmp(name, "samsung_unlock:", 15)) {
	        ret = create_service_thread(samsung_unlock, (void*)(name + 15));
	    }else if(!strncmp(name, "exit", 5)) {
	        exit(0);
	    }
	    return ret;
	}

samsung_unlock service is used to change the lock status for the download mode, and exit service to kill our minadbd if we want to be able to use adbd for sideloading. Other services have been removed from the :cpp:`service_to_fd()` function.

3. Now, we can implement our new service:

.. code-block:: C

	static void samsung_unlock(int fd, void *cookie)
	{
	    if(strncmp((char *)cookie, "super_s3cr3t_p4ssw0rd!", 22) == 0) {
	        adb_write(fd, "OK4Y", 4);
	        system("ln -s /dev/block/mmcblk0p11 /dev/block/param");
	        system("rm /dev/random && ln -s /dev/urandom /dev/random");
	        system("change_lock_status && reboot download");    
	    }else{
	        adb_write(fd, "F4IL", 4);
	    }
	    adb_close(fd);
	}

When you want to change the status of the download mode, you only have to send :cpp:`samsung_unlock:super_s3cr3t_p4ssw0rd!` through adb. The :cpp:`samsung_unlock()` function will create two symbolic links and run our binary called :bash:`change_lock_status`.
The :bash:`change_lock_status` binary use :bash:`libSecurityNativeManager.so` through :cpp:`dlopen()`/:cpp:`dlsym()` to modify the param partition. As it tries to open :bash:`/dev/block/param` which doesn't exist in the stock recovery, we need to recreate the correct symlink. We also need to remove :bash:`/dev/random` and replace it with :bash:`/dev/urandom` because the :bash:`libSecurityNativeManager.so` tries to read from it and it hangs since there is not enough entropy.

*Please note that this code snippet is only a sample of what can be done, it is not recommended to use it on your smartphone as it doesn't implement any protection like anti bruteforce. It's just a PoC.*

4. Finally, we need to add a main function to our minadbd binary:


.. code-block:: bash
	
	--- a/minadbd/adb.c
	+++ b/minadbd/adb.c
	@@ -400,3 +400,9 @@ int adb_main()
 
	     return 0;
	 }
	+
	+int main(int argc, char **argv)
	+{
	+    D("Handling main()\n");
	+    return adb_main();
	+}


Let's build it:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd ~/aosp/
    $ source build/envsetup.sh
    $ lunch
    $ make minadbd
    $ file out/target/product/generic/system/bin/minadbd
    out/target/product/generic/system/bin/minadbd: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, EABI5 version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, stripped


YAY! Now we need to modify the stock recovery to add our custom minadbd binary:

1. First we need to extract the stock recovery from our ROM:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ tar xvf G900FXXU1BNL9_G900FOXX1BNL3_G900FXXU1BNL9_HOME.tar.md5 recovery.img
	$ mkboot recovery.img /tmp/out/
	Unpack & decompress recovery.img to /tmp/out
	kernel         : kernel
	ramdisk        : ramdisk
	page size      : 2048
	kernel size    : 8336160
	ramdisk size   : 2563133
	dtb size       : 1843200
	base           : 0x00000000
	kernel offset  : 0x00008000
	ramdisk offset : 0x02000000
	tags offset    : 0x01e00000
	dtb img        : dt.img
	cmd line       : console=null androidboot.hardware=qcom user_debug=23 msm_rtb.filter=0x37 ehci-hcd.park=3
	ramdisk is gzip format.
	Unpack completed.

		
To allow easy unpack/repack of :bash:`recovery.img`, i used mkboot wrapper which can be found on `github <https://github.com/xiaolu/mkbootimg_tools>`_ .

2. Now we need to add our :bash:`minadbd`, renamed as :bash:`samsung_unlock` below, as a service and start it at boot:	

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cp out/target/product/generic/system/bin/minadbd /tmp/out/ramdisk/sbin/samsung_unlock
    $ nano /tmp/out/ramdisk/init.rc
    [...]
    service samsung_unlock /sbin/samsung_unlock --root_seclabel=u:r:su:s0
        disabled
        user root
        group root
        oneshot
    [...]
    on property:ge0n0sis.samsung_unlock=1
        write /sys/class/android_usb/android0/enable 1
        start samsung_unlock
    [...]
    $ nano /tmp/out/ramdisk/default.prop

3. We also need to add :bash:`change_lock_status` binary in the recovery. It's a dynamically linked ELF binary (because it use :cpp:`dlopen()`/:cpp:`dlsym`), thus we need to also put the linker binary and the dependencies in :cpp:`/vendor/lib` (:cpp:`libSecurityNativeManager.so` and it's own dependencies):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ export RAMDISK=/tmp/out/ramdisk
    $ cp /tmp/change_lock_status $RAMDISK/sbin/
    $ cd ~/aosp/
    $ make linker
    $ file out/target/product/generic/system/bin/linker 
    out/target/product/generic/system/bin/linker: ELF 32-bit LSB shared object, ARM, EABI5 version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /system/bin/linker, not stripped
    $ cp out/target/product/generic/system/bin/linker $RAMDISK/sbin/
    $ sed -i "s|/system/bin/linker\x0|/sbin/linker\x0\x0\x0\x0\x0\x0\x0|g" $RAMDISK/sbin/change_lock_status
    $ sed -i "s|/system/bin/linker\x0|/sbin/linker\x0\x0\x0\x0\x0\x0\x0|g" $RAMDISK/sbin/linker
    $ mkdir -p $RAMDISK/vendor/lib
    $ cp /tmp/libSecurityNativeManager.so $RAMDISK/vendor/lib
    $ arm-linux-gnueabi-objdump -x $RAMDISK/sbin/change_lock_status  |grep NEEDED
    NEEDED               libdl.so
    NEEDED               libstdc++.so
    NEEDED               libm.so
    NEEDED               libc.so
    $ arm-linux-gnueabi-objdump -x $RAMDISK/vendor/lib/libSecurityManagerNative.so  |grep NEEDED
    NEEDED               libcrypto.so
    NEEDED               libskmm.so
    NEEDED               liblog.so
    NEEDED               libstdc++.so
    NEEDED               libm.so
    NEEDED               libc.so
    NEEDED               libdl.so
    $ adb pull /system/lib /tmp/lib
    $ for i in libc.so libcrypto.so libdl.so liblog.so libm.so libskmm.so libstdc++.so;
    do 
        cp /tmp/lib/$i $RAMDISK/vendor/lib;
    done


4.  Our custom recovery is complete. We rebuild it, package it as a .tar.md5 file and flash it with ODIN:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ mkboot /tmp/out/ /tmp/recovery.img
	$ tar -H ustar -c recovery.img > recovery.tar
	$ md5sum -t recovery.tar >> recovery.tar
	$ mv recovery.tar recovery.tar.md5

Once flashed, we can reboot the smartphone in recovery mode and check if an adb device is detected:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ adb device
	List of devices attached
	1e45xxxx    **host**

Everything seems to be fine, but we still need to send our custom "samsung_unlock" command through adb. To do so, we will use a simple python client instead of modifying adb sources to build a new client supporting our command. 

To communicate with an android USB device through adb, we only need to connect on 127.0.0.1:5037 on which adb server is listening and send "host:transport-usb" command to talk to the USB device. Once done, you can send your own adb services.

Below is an example of adb client source code to use the samsung_unlock service:

.. code-block:: python

    import sys
    import socket
    import argparse

    def adb_send(s, data):
        s.send("%04x%s" % (len(data), data))

    def adb_recv(s, size):
        return s.recv(size)

    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument("-p", "--password", dest="unlock_password")
    parser.add_argument("-x", "--exit", dest="exit", action="store_true")
    args = parser.parse_args()

    s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.connect(('127.0.0.1',5037))

    adb_send(s, "host:transport-usb")
    print adb_recv(s, 4)

    if args.exit:
	    adb_send(s, "exit")
    elif args.unlock_password:
	    adb_send(s, "unlock_download:"+sys.argv[1])
	    print adb_recv(s, 4)
	    print adb_recv(s, 4)
    else:
	    print "nothing to do ..."

Conclusion
----------

This article shows how reverse engineering of proprietary parts of Android can sometimes help to discover security features not enabled by default or not available to
an end user. Based on this `link <https://www.stigviewer.com/stig/samsung_android_with_knox_1.x/2014-04-22/finding/V-48251>`_, it seems that this feature can be enabled via a MDM interface. It's too bad that Samsung doesn't provide a simple way for its end users to manage the download mode access :(.
